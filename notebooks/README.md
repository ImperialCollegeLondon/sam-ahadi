# Jupyter Notebooks - Best Practice Guide
This is a section detailing practices for Jupyter notebooks. There is an example notebook included.


# General Best Practice

Generally, you should use Jupyter notebooks for experimentation and for analysing outputs of models. They can also be good ways of making examples for non-progammers (or scientists-turned-programmers!) to use. Avoid writing lots of python into the notebooks and break these out into reusable functions with unit tests. This means you cna re-use your code!

## Github and Jupyter notebooks

Github/vscode and jupyter notebooks used to not be as well integrated previously. It was not possible to see diffs between files in commits but now it is! Make sure to update to the latest vscode version to see this. You can also use this feature to be able to properly do reviews on github now.
